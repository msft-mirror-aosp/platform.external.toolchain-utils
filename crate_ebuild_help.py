"""Help creating a Rust ebuild with CRATES.

This script is meant to help someone creating a Rust ebuild of the type
currently used by sys-apps/ripgrep and sys-apps/rust-analyzer.

In these ebuilds, the CRATES variable is used to list all dependencies, rather
than creating an ebuild for each dependency. This style of ebuild can be used
for a crate which is only intended for use in the chromiumos SDK, and which has
many dependencies which otherwise won't be used.

To create such an ebuild, there are essentially two tasks that must be done:

1. Determine all transitive dependent crates and version and list them in the
CRATES variable. Ignore crates that are already included in the main crate's
repository.

2. Find which dependent crates are not already on a chromeos mirror, retrieve
them from crates.io, and upload them to `gs://chromeos-localmirror/distfiles`.

This script parses the crate's lockfile to list transitive dependent crates,
and either lists crates to be uploaded or actually uploads them.

Of course these can be done manually instead. If you choose to do these steps
manually, I recommend *not* using the `cargo download` tool, and instead obtain
dependent crates at
`https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/{crate_version}/download`.

Example usage:

    # Here we instruct the script to ignore crateA and crateB, presumably
    # because they are already included in the same repository as some-crate.
    # This will not actually upload any crates to `gs`.
    python3 crate_ebuild_help.py --lockfile some-crate/Cargo.lock \
            --ignore crateA --ignore crateB --dry-run

    # Similar to the above, but here we'll actually carry out the uploads.
    python3 crate_ebuild_help.py --lockfile some-crate/Cargo.lock \
            --ignore crateA --ignore crateB

See the ebuild files for ripgrep or rust-analyzer for other details.
