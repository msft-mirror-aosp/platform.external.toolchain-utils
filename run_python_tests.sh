# Note that PYTHONPATH is not necessary here for regular execution, but a
# single script to run is specified, `pytest` will invoke it in a way that
# breaks toolchain-utils module importing.
#
# Exemptions:
# - git_llvm_rev_test is ignored because it takes a while. It'd be nice to
#   optionally enable it, but it's realistically very unlikely to break.
# - debug_info_test/debug_info_test.py is ignored, since that's the name of
#   a non-test script, and pytest is confused by this.
# - py/ just has symlinks to stuff back in toolchain-utils; no point in
#   checking that.
