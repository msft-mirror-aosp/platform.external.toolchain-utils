# Due to crbug.com/1081332, we need to update AFDO metadata
# manually. This script performs a few checks and generates a
# new kernel_afdo.json file, which can then be submitted.
#

USAGE="
Usage: $(basename "$0") [--noupload|-upload] [main|beta|stable|all] [--help]

Description:
  The script takes one optional argument which is the channel where we want
to update the kernel afdo and creates a commit (or commits with \"all\"
channels) in the corresponding branch.
  No arguments defaults to \"all\".
  Follow the prompt to upload the changes.
  NO CLEAN-UP NEEDED. The script ignores any local changes and keeps
the current branch unchanged.

  Args:
    --help      Show this help.
    --upload    Upload CLs when the update succeeded (default).
    --noupload  Do not upload CLs. Instead, print the upload commands.
    main|beta|stable  Update metadata only on the specified channel.

#   The second scenario is when we want to disable kernel AFDO (when all devices
#   move to kernelnext and there are no new profiles from the field). In this
#   case we disable AFDO in main but still keep it live in beta and stable.
