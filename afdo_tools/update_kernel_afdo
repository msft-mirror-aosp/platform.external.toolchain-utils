# Due to crbug.com/1081332, we need to update AFDO metadata
# manually. This script performs a few checks and generates a
# new kernel_afdo.json file, which can then be submitted.
#

USAGE="
Usage: $(basename "$0") [main|beta|stable|all] [--help]

Description:
  The script takes one optional argument which is the channel where we want
to update the kernel afdo and creates a commit (or commits with \"all\"
channels) in the corresponding branch.
  No arguments defaults to \"all\".
  Follow the prompt to upload the changes.
  NO CLEAN-UP NEEDED. The script ignores any local changes and keeps
the current branch unchanged.

# NOTE: We enable/disable kernel AFDO starting from a particular branch.

#   The second scenario is when we want to disable kernel AFDO (when all devices
#   move to kernelnext and there are no new profiles from the field). In this
#   case we disable AFDO in main but still keep it live in beta and stable.
